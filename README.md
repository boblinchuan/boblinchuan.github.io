# My Personal Website
This is the code for my personal website.

7/25/15: Version 0.1
Spent the day at InternHacks 2015, hosted by General Assembly.
Put together a basic website with some tabs regarding my current info.
Next step: 
    Create a projects page to host the projects I build.
    Add more info about me.
    Make it prettier.
